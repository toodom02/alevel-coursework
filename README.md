    Kingfisher Trust
</h1>

This is the sourcecode for my A-Level Computer Science coursework, an SQLite database system with GUI designed for the operations of the Kingfisher trust charity and cafe.

## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure `Python 3.8.1` or greater is installed
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `main.py`

## Usage

The database file `cafeDB.db` currently contains dummy data for showcasing.

`/reports` also contains exemplary pdf reports with dummy data.

Log in to the system with the usernames and passwords below.

| USERNAME    | PASSWORD    | ACCESS LEVEL  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| admin       | admin       | 3             |
| ST21750     | password    | 3             |
| ST08639     | password    | 2             |
| ST05797     | password    | 3             |
| ST44543     | password    | 1             |
